    BERTopic is an advanced topic modeling technique that uses embeddings and clustering to extract coherent topics from textual data. Unlike traditional models like LDA, BERTopic is capable of capturing nuanced patterns in textual data, making it particularly useful for analyzing legislative text.  
    **Example from Analysis**:
    - Using BERTopic, we identified the top 12 topics in climate-related bills. These topics provided valuable insights into recurring themes such as electric vehicles, environmental justice, tax credits, and emissions reduction.
    - The model also allowed us to trace topic trends and across states and party, helping us uncover key legislative focus areas.

    The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 represents the largest climate investment in U.S. history, making it a pivotal milestone for climate-related legislation. The IRA focuses heavily on climate initiatives and tax credits designed to drive decarbonization and clean energy adoption.  
    **Key Highlights of IRA**:
    - **Investment**: A historic $369 billion allocated for energy security and climate change programs over 10 years.
    - **Tax Credits**: Substantial tax incentives for renewable energy projects, electric vehicles, and energy-efficient home upgrades.
    - **Climate Goals**: Expected to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 40% below 2005 levels by 2030.
    - **Jobs**: Projected to create thousands of clean energy jobs across the country, boosting economic growth in green sectors.
    - **Equity Focus**: Emphasizes environmental justice by investing in underserved communities disproportionately affected by climate change.
